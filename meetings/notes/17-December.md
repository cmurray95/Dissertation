# Progress
- Couldn't get the flag to work to confirm upload - kept having issues running functions from the device using UART (i believe UART.eval should work - but the data i get back doesn't) seem usable
- Got demo ready to implement with the uploader once i figure out the flag issue
- Plan to work on it over xmas break
# Discussion
- UART.eval seems to return an undefined object. Happens even when using dump() to try and retrieve code off the device
# Guidance #
- Make better use of supervisor to help with any code i find online that i don't fully understand
# Goals #
- Finish demo and basic functionallity before january 14th meeting
