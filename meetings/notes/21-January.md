# Progress
- Refactored uploader code to conform to ES6 standards and features
- Fixed some hardware issues
- Kept trying to get demo app working
# Discussion
- Uploader works in terms of pulling remote code, and sending to device, and alerting user when upload is finished. however, carrying that over to a seperate page with which the user can interact with the device doesn't seem to be possible based on what i know so far
