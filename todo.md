# Links to all demos:
## Demos Built While Testing 
- Puck Demo - https://cmurray95.github.io/Dissertation/src/demos/colour-test.html
  - This was the first demo built for the project, and was a very simple test to better understand how espruino devices (and web bluetooth devices in general) worked
- UART Demo - https://cmurray95.github.io/Dissertation/src/demos/puck-demo/index.html
  - This demo was built using the uart.js library as a way to learn how it worked before I began working on the remote-uploader
- Remote-Uploader test - https://cmurray95.github.io/Dissertation/src/demos/remote-uploader-testing/index.html
  - This served as a playground of sorts, used to test various features of the remote-uploader before they were pushed to the main repo
- Pixl Demo - https://cmurray95.github.io/Dissertation/src/demos/pixl-demo/index.html
  - The pixl demo was used to debug various issues encountered whilst working on the remote-uploader tool. 

The above demos were all built solely for testing, and as such lack any styling or user friendliness. 

Better versions of these demos, rebuilt using the remote-uploader tool, are all available at the documentation page for the remote-uploader tool here - https://cmurray95.github.io/espruino-remote-uploader/demos/demos.html
