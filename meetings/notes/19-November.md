# Progress
* Discovered Nordic UART - This seems like a more viable option for writing the remote uploader than the espruino node library
* More research into API design
# Discussion
* Found that a UART.js library already exists for writing code to the device - is a more universal web blueooth script than the puck.js library
* Converted the node.js demo to use the uart.js library
