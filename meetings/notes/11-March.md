# Progress
- Made pixl demo interactive
- Made good progress on finishing documentation/demos. Hoping to have these published over the weekend
# Discussion
- What is the best way to include video demonstrations within the dissertation?
- Encountered more issues regarding the delay for uploading - deciding to set this to 10 seconds by default, then allow the user to set a custom delay if they desire. There are too many devices to consider, and future devices may be developed, which vary in read/write times.
# Guidance #
- For including video demonstrations, a short url in the dissertation is fine.
- Include visual aids e.g. gifs etc on the documentation pages
# Goals #
- Post link to documentation
- Post video demo
