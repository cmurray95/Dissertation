# Progress
* Setup both devices
* Ran through various tutorials on espruino website
# Discussion
* Can't get the espruino node package to work - pythons bleak package runs, and the webIDE run. Waiting on a new adapter to arrive to see if its a possible issue with the bluetooth adapter i am currently using
* If I can get the Node package to work, then I can begin starting the process of writing the code uploader. 
# Guidance #
* Keep jonathan updated with my progress
* Main objective is to make the code uploader user friendly - keep this in mind when writing the API
# Goals #
* Figure out issue with the espruino node package
* Get started on the remote code uploader
