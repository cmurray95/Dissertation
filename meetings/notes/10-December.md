# Progress
- https://www.espruino.com/Saving - this seems to imply that saving to flash memory should be done on the user side (implemented on the code to be uploaded - not directly by the remote uploader)
- "demo" ideas 
- - Smart meter
- - Light controller (Button switch, motion sensor, time based)
# Discussion
- how to begin communication between app and device after upload?
- Best method of checking if upload is complete?
# Guidance #
- Can use a embeded flag to alert uploader when transfer is done
- Once complete, user can then handle how their own app communicates with the device
# Goals #
- WEbpage change colour of puck 
- checks for code uploaded/code to be uploaded
- return flag
