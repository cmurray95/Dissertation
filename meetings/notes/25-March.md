# Progress
- Documentation Finished
- Evaluation Finished
- Applied a lot of bug fixes and refactorings to the codebase
- Got the asynceval solution working; although haven't implemented to the main codebase yet as unsure how best to do this when the dissertation discusses the delay solution
- Wrote up draft of dissertation
- Updated my CI workflow to make publishing new versions of the uploader smoother
# Discussion
- How to know what needs an explanation and what doesn't? For example, it is worth devoting a section to espruino itself and the devices available, however what about more common tools, for example node
- I have sequence diagrams, UML diagrams etc. Would these be best placed in the design section, or the implementation section of the dissertation?
- I've included links in the readme to advise the reader that the "release" version of the uploader is on github, and is seperate from the dissertation itself. However, in the marking scheme it says that the marker is not necessarily required to look at anything except the dissertation paper. Where in the paper would it be appropiate to point to this?
# Guidance #
- Discuss technologies using "general" terms. For example a user may know what a package manager is, but not what NPM is specifically. Use the concept of a package manager to explain NPM to the users.
# Goals #
- Draft ready for tuesday. Share overleaf link
